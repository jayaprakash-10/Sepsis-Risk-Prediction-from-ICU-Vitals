# 🧠 Sepsis Risk Prediction from ICU Vitals

This project is a real-time machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of **sepsis onset** in ICU patients using clinical vital signs and lab values. Built with **Streamlit**, **XGBoost**, and **SHAP**, it enables both predictive alerts and feature-level explainability — critical in high-stakes healthcare settings.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Input real-time ICU vitals and labs
- 🤖 Predict sepsis risk using a trained XGBoost model
- 🚨 Trigger alert if risk exceeds threshold (default: 0.7)
- 🔬 Visual explanation using SHAP waterfall plot
